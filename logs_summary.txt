Summary of Media Extraction Failures
1. Facebook: Authentication Requirements

Issue: yt-dlp fails because the video is restricted to registered users.

Error: This video is only available for registered users. Use --cookies-from-browser or --cookies for the authentication.

Feedback: The system needs a mechanism to handle authenticated sessions or provide cookies to yt-dlp for Facebook URLs to avoid "registered user" blocks.

2. Reddit: JSON/MIME and 403 Blocks

Issue A: Primary extraction method fails when encountering HTML instead of the expected JSON.

Error A: Attempt to decode JSON with unexpected mimetype: text/html.

Issue B: yt-dlp is being blocked by Reddit.

Error B: HTTP Error 403: Blocked.

Feedback: Reddit's API/web layout changes are causing JSON parsing errors, and yt-dlp is likely being throttled or blocked by Reddit’s anti-bot measures (may require User-Agent rotation or proxy usage).

3. TikTok: Download "Forbidden" (403)

Issue: While media metadata is successfully extracted, the actual download of the video file fails consistently.

Error: media_download_failed error="403, message='Forbidden'" from v19-webapp-prime.tiktok.com.

Feedback: The extracted video URLs are likely signed or time-sensitive, and the download client is being rejected by TikTok's CDN.

4. Instagram: Parsing and Content Type Issues

Issue A: Parsing errors (likely empty responses or unexpected HTML).

Error A: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0).

Issue B: Handling of non-video posts.

Error B: yt-dlp failed: ERROR: [Instagram] ... There is no video in this post.

Feedback: Instagram extraction is fragile; it fails on empty data and does not gracefully handle "Image-only" posts, leading to a total extraction failure.
